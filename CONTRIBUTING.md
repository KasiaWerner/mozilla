Add a bit of welcome and cheer at the top

Restart your project vision here. Redundancy is your friend
>[The Open Education Cooperative] is the movement for teachers and educators who want to work and teach open. We believe that openness needs cooperation and support from deferent environments. The method is based on cooperation and openness as well as the knowledge exchange and bonds building with the communities which do not operate in education on a daily basis. The project enhances the role of students in school in such a way that they have impact on the materials which they learn from. The teachers will become the ambassadors of openness and democratic education in their environment. The project is hold by education team of Centrum Cyfrowe. We start first workshops for teachers in march 2018. On the end of June we will have first effects of our work. Four new open education resources for mathematic. In the same time we are working on online course. Right now we are looking for good practices and materials from all over the world.

During MozSpirnt we are working on:
1. The map of good practices: we are looking for different ideas of making and using OER and also some models of cooperation in education - between teachers, teachers and students and school/bussines/art/politics
2. We are looking for good places and people to promote our idea and materials.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
